Magma scripts to support the computations in the paper "Higher modularity of
elliptic curves over function fields", by A. Logan and J. Weinstein with an
appendix by M. Kuwata.

script-threefold.mag    Verifies the claims of theorem 4.3.1.
magic-i9-new.mag        Checks the statements at the end of 3.6.1.
ans-i9.mag              Just gives the answers in magic-i9.mag.
zr.mag                  Writes down equations for the space Z^r.
univ-ec.mag             Verifies one claim in proposition 2.7.3 (uses zr.mag).
project.mag             Auxiliary functions for finding images of maps.
infnear.mag             Auxiliary functions for mapping infinitely near points on curves.
auxil.mag               A few auxiliary functions for blowups, removing base schemes, reducing matrices, etc.
